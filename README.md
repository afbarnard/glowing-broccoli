# glowing-broccoli


This is a repository I am using for algorithms and data structures
practice.  The goal is to implement an algorithm or data structure in a
"test environment".  That is, implement it without any references,
without running it or testing it, and do it all as fast as possible.
The code gets committed in this "raw" state and then I will come back
and test it and fix it and make it proper and perhaps even make it
nicer.  This last stage is "open book" and uses as much time as needed.

Since this is a scratch repository, I decided I would use whatever name
GitHub suggested.  That name happened to be "glowing-broccoli".  Not
bad.  Even sounds sort of cool.  Probably not something I would eat.

Of course, everything is MIT-licensed in case you want to use it for
anything.  But use at your own risk!
