# For practice, implement the following linked list operations as both
# (plain) recursive and tail-recursive functions [1].  Use helper functions
# where appropriate.  (Tail-recursive functions usually need helper
# functions with additional arguments to carry along values before
# returning them.)
#
# These are my recollections on the types of exercises we had to do in
# Scheme [2] for Intro CS at St. Olaf.  In accord with Scheme, all lists
# are chains of (item, next) pairs, and no iteration is allowed.  Since
# pairs are immutable in Scheme (and in Python), the following functions
# must all work by building new lists out of the old lists.  There is no
# such thing as modifying the list in place.
